# Action-Recognition-to-Speech
Deep learning action recognition model

In this repository you will find the code to collect and process data, detect keypoints, and extract keypoints from said data then feed these keypoints into a deep learning model which will learn to recognize actions. Using mediapipe holistic the model will make detections, visualize landmarks and extract keypoints to later be fed into LSTM layers of our model. 

I will also be including a helper file that is unofficially a pipelearn to extract data and build then train our model.

This project was built using the libraries tensorflow,opencv,mediapipe, and os.
